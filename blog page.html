		<p> Okay, after a few more days of work, I think it's starting to come together. It's a lot of work to make seemingly miniscule changes, but everything slowly adds up! I'm working now on uploading content to the site -- I have a backlog of some works I've written over the last few years that I am pretty proud of. They should start showing up in the next few days. I've suddenly become pretty self-conscious about my writing. What's my mom going to think? Lol, I'm sure I'll get over it. Anyway, this project has been pretty fun and gratifying so far. I am looking forward to sharing it. Happy Monday!

		<p> It is currently 12:35 AM. Nina is asleep in bed to my left, but I can't sleep! So I'm working on the website instead. So far, I've changed the font, background and text colors, and added responsive margins to the left and right. I'm pretty happy with it. Ok, back to bed. </p>

		<p> Hello! This is my first blog post. Today, I am working on the rough outline of how I want my site to look and building the skeleton. ChatGPT is helping a lot! Once I have the skeleton of the site built, I will be working on the CSS programming that will make the site look beautiful! </p>
